# ESS-Based-Citrus-Leaf-Classification-and-Disease-Detection
This project focuses on detecting and classifying citrus leaf diseases using a deep learning-based approach. The model is enhanced using ESS-based techniques to improve feature extraction and classification accuracy. Additionally, the system can be extended to support real-time monitoring and visualization of predictions.
